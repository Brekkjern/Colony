# Colony
A game set in the future about managing colonists on a far off planet without outside help. Drawing inspiration from other games and media like the old Outpost series, Battlestar Galactica and Dwarf Fortress.

## Contributions
I welcome any contributions to the project. Much of the progress can be attributed to the fine folks at CodeTalk.io and #Outpost2 channel at Quakenet.org.

## WARNING
This is a programming exercise for me. The game is not functional at the time of writing and I make no guarantees on the functionality of this program.
