# Colony One
Colony One centres around handling a colony on a far off alien planet containing refugees from Earths failing ecosystem. Their resources and manpower is scarce and you need to plan what you research and construct. The environment is hostile which contains your colonists inside the structures and vehicles they brought to the planets surface. You will have to manage colony morale in the cramped spaces in the face of possible extinction of the human race. Balance the health and morale of your colonists versus your resources and either adapt to your environment or find a new home for the last strand of humanity in the known universe.

Drawing inspiration from other games and media like the Outpost series, Battlestar Galactica, The Expanse, Dune, Civilization, Stellaris and Dwarf Fortress.
